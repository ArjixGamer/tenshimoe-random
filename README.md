A userscript that adds a random anime button to Tenshi.moe

The Python script is for generating ``all_anime.json`` that is going to be used by the userscript.

I have a workflow set up to update it every 5 days.

To install the userscript head over to [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423727-tenshi-moe-random-anime)
